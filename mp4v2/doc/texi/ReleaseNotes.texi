@chapter What's New?
Version 2.1.2 fixes build system issues, mainly in the CMake build system support. This release also fixes a file seeking
issue observed on Windows when compiled with _WIN32_WINNT < 0x600 and linked against modern CRT DLLs. In addition, two minor
issues related to data handling are fixed.

Version 2.1.1 fixes a type mismatch preventing MP4v2 from compiling on 32 bit systems.

Version 2.1 updates the existing build systems and adds support for building with CMake and Xcode. It also fixes compilation
with newer compilers and integrates smaller improvements and bug fixes from various MP4v2 forks.
